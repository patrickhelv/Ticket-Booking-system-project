# Ticket-Booking-system-project
Created a ticket booking smart contract in Solidity, in the course TTM4195 - Blockchain Technologies and Cryptocurrencies. 
The project consisted in creating a Ticket booking system where people could purchase tickets for events by using etherium.
We used the NFT repository to create these tickets that are seen as tokens on the blockchain. We implemented some methods
to be able to trade these tokens with other users either in the exchange of another ticket or ETH. 

Once the ticket for the show is no longer needed, we implemented a method to burn up all the tokens that are associated with the user defined event.

## Requirements 
- Have to run the smart contract on the blockchain, easiest is to run on the Etherium test blockchain.
- You Can use https://remix-project.org/
